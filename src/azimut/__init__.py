# through hatchling's dynamic version (``[tool.hatch.version]``) and the
# extension manifest is kept in lock-step by a test, so a release is bumped in
# exactly one place. Getting this wrong nags every user with a false update
# (the binary's self-check compares this against the latest GitHub tag).

# Cap the pixels Pillow will decode from a file, process-wide. A tiny,
# highly-compressed image can otherwise expand to gigabytes in memory and take
# the process down (a local denial of service). 100 MP sits far above any
# legitimate input — a screenshot, a satellite crop (≤4096²) or a proof — and
# well under Pillow's ~179 MP default. This only guards *decoding untrusted
# files*; composites built with Image.new() are unaffected. Set here because
# importing azimut is the one thing every entry point does first.
