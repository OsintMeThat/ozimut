"""Is a newer Azimut out? — a self-check for the binary, which has no package
manager behind it (a ``pip``/``pipx`` user runs ``pipx upgrade`` instead).

Local-first: this reaches the network only when the user presses "Check for
updates" (api/settings.py gates it behind ``?check=true``, the same opt-in the
scraper check uses). Nothing here runs on launch or on opening Settings.
