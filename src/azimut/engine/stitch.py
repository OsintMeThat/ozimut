"""Auto-stitch: solve a collage layout from overlapping imagery (spec § v2 Panorama).

The hand-made collage lets an analyst drag and warp pieces into a panorama by eye
(``engine/inspect.compose_perspective``). This module does the same job by machine
— *but it deliberately stops at the layout*. It returns each piece's geometry
rather than a flattened panorama, so the result drops straight back onto the
collage canvas as ordinary pieces: still draggable, still exported by the same
compositor. Machine stitch first, hand-tune after.

Two projection models, because one cannot serve both jobs (:func:`solve_layout`
and :func:`solve_rotation_layout`):

**Planar** assumes the pieces show one flat surface — a facade, the ground, a map.
Homographies chain from the best-connected image (the anchor) outward and every
piece lands in the anchor's *plane*, so a piece stays an ordinary 4-point quad the
analyst can keep warping by hand. The catch is that a panning camera is a rotation,
not a plane: re-expressing it as one divides every piece by ``cos(angle)`` from the
anchor, so pieces blow up towards the edges and run to infinity at 90°.

**Rotation** (cylindrical / spherical) is the model for a camera that turns. It
solves a rotation + focal length per piece, refines them all together (bundle
adjustment, so pairwise error can't accumulate into a banana), and projects onto a
cylinder or a sphere — which unrolls to a *bounded* strip however far the camera
pans, keeping verticals vertical and pieces the same size end to end. The price is
that a curved warp is not a quad: the piece's pixels are remapped (a ``remap`` op
baked into its recipe, so the full-res export re-derives it) and the piece is
placed as an upright rectangle. It stays draggable — it is no longer corner-warpable.

The heavy lifting is OpenCV's; the fitting math is pure so it stays testable and
honest about coordinates.

    """Solve a panorama layout under the rotation model — geometry *and* a remap.

    Returns ``{"quads": {index: quad}, "remaps": {index: params}, "dropped": [...]}``.
    Each quad is the upright rectangle the piece's remapped pixels fill, in canvas
    pixels; each remap is the op that produces those pixels from the piece's
    recipe. ``dropped`` holds the pieces no trusted match reached — the caller
    leaves them untouched, exactly as in :func:`solve_layout`.
