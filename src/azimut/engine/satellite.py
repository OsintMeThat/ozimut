"""Satellite captures and their one-to-one ``capture`` entities.

A capture is a satellite imagery crop. It is filed through the *media* pipeline
(:mod:`azimut.engine.media`) so it lives in ``<case>/media/`` alongside every
other image — hashed, thumbnailed, listed in the Media Library and openable in
Inspect — but it is registered under a ``capture`` entity (not ``media``) that
carries the crop's coordinates/zoom/bearing. Its media sidecar's ``source`` dict
holds the full capture provenance (provider, attribution, acquisition, …) with
``type == "satellite"``, which is how a capture is told apart from an ordinary
media item both here and in the Media Library facet.

Because a capture *is* a media item, all of its lifecycle (list/patch/delete)
funnels through the media engine; this module only adds the satellite-flavoured
listing view the Satellite tool's "Saved › Captures" panel consumes.
